# Source-Coding-and-Channel-Coding

Here it covers the source coding and channel coding approaches in Digital Communications using MATLAB functions.

Following approaches are implemented.
1. Developing a Function for Huffman Coding Algorithm
2. Arithmetic Coding Algorithms 
3. Dictionary Coding Using Lempel-Ziv-Welch Algorithm
4. Transmission of data over an AWGN channel
5. Error correction using Hamming codes

All the needed steps, functions, calculations and explanations are mentioned in the code file.
